# Rice crop detection and rice yield estimation using CNN, LSTM, and Extra Trees Regression models
The entire project was decomposed into 5 stages: Acquiring domain knowledge, Exploratory data analysis, Feature engineering, Modelling, and Evaluation. Utilising data from Microsoftâ€™s Planetary Computer, including Sentinel-1 (radar) and Sentinel-2 (optical) satellite data, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Extra Trees Regression algorithms were implemented to build identification and prediction models for a given season in the Chau Thanh, Thoai Son and Chau Phu regions of Vietnam that:

                  - Level 1: Identify the areas where rice is cultivated.
                  
                  - Level 2: For any identified area of rice cultivation, forecast yield.
